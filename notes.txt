-prb: check small buffer size for small tau e.g. 1

remove all memcpy
check cvmSet
check sorted filter
double check temporalconv
double check harrisfunction
role of delay?


-use OpenMP and intel compiler for benefiting from multicore
-gray scale conversion
-two types of smoothing
	1-using FFT
	2-separable convolution

-playing video file in correct timing (important?)
-visualizing Hbuffer
-many steps can be paralleized 
-which one is enough and faster IPL_DEPTH_32F, IPL_DEPTH_64F  or even integer type
-CV_TURN_ON_IPL_COMPATIBILITY ?
-how to get number of total frame and FPS in case of input file and video stream
- //*** scale 1st order partial derivatives for the correspondance with Matlab 0.25 0.5 ???
-Q: how discrete derivitives should be resacle in order to correspond continous deriverives? (sign and scale)

- MATLAB colormap equivalent for OpenCV

rules for pch
==========================================
put all frequently used header in pcheader.h
for enabling pch, define USE_PCH in addition to compiler options for pch
pch can be turned off by not defining USE_PCH
VC++: when pch is enabled (/Y[cux]) all the cpp files should include pchheader
